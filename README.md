Semester Project for Database Management Systems
In this project, we are tasked with designing a database with front-end and back-end capabilities that serves a real-world functional purpose. For this project, I will be exploring Contractor-Client interface systems and developing one of my own using MySQL and website production languages, namely CSS , JS, and HTML.
