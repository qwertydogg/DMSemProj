# DMSemProj
Semester Project for Database Management Systems
In this project, we are tasked with designing a database with front-end and back-end capabilities that serves a real-world functional purpose. For this project, I will be exploring Contractor-Client interface systems and developing one of my own using MySQL and website production languages, namely CSS , JS, and HTML. Included in this selection of project files thus far is the MySQL code to initialize the database for use within the future application, as well as code for the creation and deletion of said database. The end goal is to have developed a working CRM, Customer Relationship Management System, to be applied to the consumer relations industry. This project is being undertaken using React.js, Node,js, and Express.js for development of the Frontend and to create a simple API for fetching and writing data to and from the MySQL database in the Backend.
